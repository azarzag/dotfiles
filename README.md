## My Dotfiles

**ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Duncan and these are my Dotfiles.**

I regularly switch between two MacBook Pro's (one for work, one for personal/side project use). My Dotfiles are essential to ensuring I have the same development experience on both MacBooks - they help me keep settings in sync & setup new Macs when I need to.

I've tried to keep everything nice & organised - feel free to take a look around and steal anything you want.

### Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/duncanmcclean/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
- `bash ~/.dotfiles/install`

### What's being used

- [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) for window management and keyboard shortcuts
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is my shell (using iTerm as my terminal)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for dependency management
