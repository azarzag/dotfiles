## My Dotfiles

**Hey, I'm Duncan and these are my dotfiles.** I use two MacBook Pro's regularly (one for work, one for personal use), so my dotfiles are essential to ensuring I have a similar/same development experience on both machines. My dotfiles are incredibly useful when setting up new computers.

You're free to take a look around how I've got things setup and copy any of it to your own dotfiles. I've tried to keep everything nice & organised.

### Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/duncanmcclean/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
- `bash ~/.dotfiles/install`

### What's being used

- Hammerspoon for window management and keyboard shortcuts
- Oh My Zsh is my shell (using iTerm as my terminal)
- Homebrew for dependency management

### Things to look into

- Dotbot
- Maybe switch up my iTerm theme
- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
- Make use of Valet's new 'different PHP versions per site' feature (need to change some aliases)
